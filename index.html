    <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>

      <p>
        Even as a child, Zoro was strong enough to defeat most adults, but could not defeat Kuina, the daughter of the dojo's master, Koushirou. During a training session, Zoro met and talked with Kuina's grandfather, Shimotsuki Kouzaburou, who gifted him a pair of swords to aid in his practice. The following year while both Zoro and Kuina were training, the Revolutionary Army stopped by their dojo. At some point Zoro came to Koushirou asking if it was true if swordsmen could cut through anything and even steel to which Koushiro confirmed. He then demonstrated to Zoro a piece of paper that he cut without it splitting confusing Zoro, Koushiro then explained to Zoro that part of swordsmanship lies within a sword understanding the will of what the swordsman wishes to protect and what and when he wishes to cut. Further telling Zoro that a sword that cuts and injures anything it touches isn't a real sword, Zoro then told his sensei he would strive to become a swordsman that could cut through anything making Koushirou question if he was listening at all.

        Zoro's abilities include his powerful Three-Sword Style, mastery of Haki (Armament, Observation, and Conqueror's), immense physical strength and agility, and exceptional swordsmanship to cut anything, from steel to the very air itself. He also uses Foxfire Style and has shown advanced Haki skills, such as imbuing swords with advanced Conqueror's Haki to create a "black blade".
